\cite{lakefs}
Similarly to DVC, LakeFS is a format-agnostic solution. Similarly to Git LFS and
DVC, it works on basis of file pointers being stored in a Key Value Store (such
as Postgres Database) and the content of the files being stored in Object Store
Bucket (support of S3 compatible systems) (Figure
\ref{fig:dvc-architecture})\cite{architecture-lakefs}. While lacking in certain
features of DVC (data pipelines definitions and visualisations), it offers
higher degree of scalability by implementation of immutable ranges. Range is a
set of pointers to files (in sorted order), containing metadata. Metaranges
contain ranges, with commit serving as a pointer to a set of metaranges. Thus,
when modifying files we can reuse certain ranges, that have not been modified,
which leads to more efficient storage management (Figure
\ref{fig:lakefs-ranges}).

zero-copy branching - no data duplication
configurable garbage collection
format-agnostic (both structured and unstructed)
data management using S3 interface (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage)
uses metafiles (similar to DVC)
tools for CI/CD
can be ran locally or in cloud

maybe something more about datalakes?
spomen caching (respektive jeho neexistenciu)
