\paragraph{Types of Data Version Control Systems (DVCS)}
According to Zolkifli et al. \cite{zolkifli2018version} in centralised DVCS, a
singular repository is located on the server. These DVCS are suitable for teams
with smaller number of members, with the team being located in a single place.
Only the last version of a file is retrieved and there is a single point of
failure. Examples include Apache Subversion or Perforce Revision Control System.
In distributed DVCS, on the other hand, each user has one local repository.
Examples include Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Bitkeeper. This type is suitable
regardless of team size. It also enables users being located in different parts
of the world. Clients can create their own branches and sync them with the
server.
