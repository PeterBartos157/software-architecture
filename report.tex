\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In the abstract, first introduce the context of your work.
Then, state what are your contributions, starting from the most important one (it's fine to have only one contribution, of course).
Explain why your contributions should be considered right.
For this, it's best if you can indicate how you evaluated them.
Finally, position your contributions in a broader context: why are they important, where they can be applied, how they can be extended\ldots

An abstract may repeat the sentences from the main text.
Don't be afraid to modify them, though,
as an abstract has to be short.
It's very likely you'll find the context of your work in the introduction of your paper,
and all the rest you need for your abstract in the concluding section.
\end{abstract}



\section{Introduction} \label{in}

\ldots

The rest of this report\footnote{This report has been submitted in partial fulfillemnt of the Aspect-Oriented Software Development 2018/19 course completion conditions (\url{http://fiit.sk/~vranic/aosd/}). Supervised by Valentino Vranić.}
is structured as follows.
Section~\ref{insight} provides an insight into\ldots{}
Section~\ref{approaches} explains in more detail some important approaches to\ldots{}
Section~\ref{initial} brings the initial steps to\ldots{}
(Characterize each section by a sentence.)
Section~\ref{cc} concludes the paper and indicates some directions for further work.




\section{Insight into\ldots} \label{insight}

Present your insight into the state of the art.
Favor comparison and critique over description.
Avoid lengthy descriptions with lots of quoted material.

Refer to literature properly, e.g.,
``Many authors have tried to\ldots~\cite{Vranic:AJParadigms,Alexander:Timeless}, but\ldots'' 

Use your own title for this section.

You may structure your sections (see below).
If you use subsections, use at least two, i.e., don't put only one subsection.

It might be a good idea to explain the structure of the rest of the section. Sometimes, an explicit way of doing at just as is demonstrated at the end of the introduction (see Section~\ref{in}).


\subsection{Some Aspects} \label{insight-some}

\ldots

\subsection{Other Aspects} \label{insight-other}

\ldots



\section{Important Approaches to\ldots} \label{approaches}

You may need one more section to treat the state of the art.
Everything said for the previous section, holds for this one, too.




\section{Initial Steps to\ldots} \label{initial}

Describe your own approach.
Of course, use your own title for this section.

Put your diagrams in figures as so-called floating object.
Refer to them using their numbers.
E.g., ``in Figure~\ref{f:gen-spec} we can see\ldots''

\begin{figure}[tbh] \centering
\includegraphics[scale=\magnf]{fig/gen-spec}
\caption{Generally applicable and domain specific changes.}
\label{f:gen-spec}
\end{figure}


You may include code snippets to explain what you've done:
\ajset
\begin{lstlisting}
public class SMTPServerM extends SMTPServer {
   . . .
}
. . .
public aspect SMTPServerBackupA {
   public pointcut SMTPServerConstructor(URL url, String user, String password):
      call(SMTPServer.new(..)) && args (url, user, password);
   SMTPServer around(URL url, String user, String password):
      SMTPServerConstructor(url, user, password) {
      return getSMTPServerBackup(proceed(url, user, password));
   }
   private SMTPServer getSMTPServerBackup(SMTPServer obj) {
      if (obj.isConnected()) {
         return obj;
      }
      else {
         return new SMTPServerM(obj.getUrl(), obj.getUser(),
            obj.getPassword());
      }
   }
}
\end{lstlisting}

If you need to display more code, use appendices referring the reader to them, e.g.,
``see Appendix~\ref{some} for a more detailed example.''



\section{Further Steps to\ldots} \label{further}

You may need several sections to describe your approach.



\section{Evaluation} \label{eval}

You may describe your evaluation efforts in a separate, often generically entitled section.

\subsection{Essential Evaluation} \label{eval-essential}

Use your own title here.

\subsection{Threats to Validity} \label{eval-threats}

\ldots



\section{Related Work} \label{rw}

Compare your achievements to related ones achieved by others.



\section{Conclusions and Further Work} \label{cc}

% Conclusions
Emphasize the main results.

% Further Work
Indicate what can be done next.

The concluding section is typically not decomposed into subsections.
Simply use several paragraphs to present conclusions,
and then use at least one paragraph to indicate further/future work.

\section{Some Appendix} \label{some}


\section{Yet Another Appendix} \label{yetanother}
